# Visual Querying of Large Multilayer Graphs
### A new approah for the analysis of complex data containing different types of relations and modeled in the form of multilayer graphs.

## Resume

Many real world data can be represented by a network with a set of
nodes linked each other by multiple relations. Such a rich graph is
called multilayer graph. In this demo, we present a tool for Visual
Querying of Large Multilayer Graphs that allows to visually draw
the query, retrieve result patterns and finally navigate and browse
the results considering the original multilayer graph database. Our
approach does not only provide a graphical user interface for the
graph engine but the query processing is fully integrated.

This code is the implementation that have been used in:
